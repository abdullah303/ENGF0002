bug 1: If a bomb misses a building it will fall forever and not reset. The bomb should reset when
       it falls off of the screen. You can reproduce this by dropping a bomb from the plane that
       missed the buildings. I fixed this by resetting the bomb if it goes past CANVAS_HEIGHT.

bug 2: It is impossible to hit the rightmost building. The plane spawns in too far left for a bomb
       to be able to hit the rightmost building in time. The plane should spawn in further right
       so that it can hit the building. This can be reproduced by attempting to hit the rightmost
       building. I fixed this by increasing CANVAS_WIDTH

bug 3: Buildings do not get deleted when flatened. They just stay at the bottom of the screen. The
       building should be deleted when flattened. This can be reproduced by attempting to flatten
       a building. I fixed it by implementing the delete_building() function.

bug 4: If a wing hits a building it will cause a game over, even though in the comments it says we 
       dont worry if a wing hits. It shouldnt be a game over, if a wing hits. I fixed it by deleteing
       the part of the if statement that checks if a wing has hit.

bug 5: If you flatten all the buildings you do not get 1000 points and go to the next level. You
       keep flying until you hit the floor and get a game over. You should get 1000 points and move
       to the next level. This can be reproduced by flattening all the buildings. I fixed this by
       adding some tolerance to the if statement that checks if the plane has landed.
